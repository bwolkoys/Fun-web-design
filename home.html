        <h1 class="hone">THE WEEDON FAMILY RANCH</h1>
        <p1 class="pone">The Weedon Family Ranch is a rare and unique property that offers a truly exceptional experience. Located at
            the base of Canyons Village at Park City Mountain, this 12.1-acre property provides breathtaking views and
            unparalleled access to the surrounding mountains. The gated entrance on White Pine Canyon Road and Red Pine
            Road ensures a sense of seclusion and exclusivity, while providing easy access and walkability to skiing,
            dining and retail. Grassy hills, pines, aspens and water features combine to create an incredible property
            that offers guests a main house, a loft apartment, a guest house and modern barn. The main house rests
            within a beautiful cluster of trees with a large deck on the banks of a creek. The guest apartment is
            located a breezeway away from the main house and provides additional family or friends a private escape. A
            short walk away sits a beautifully appointed guest home offering expansive views and vaulted ceilings. The
            property also includes a modern barn, stables, training coral and approximately two acres of fenced-in
            pasture, providing an equestrian dream against the majestic backdrop of White Pine Canyon.</p1>
